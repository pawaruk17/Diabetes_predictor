# Diabetes_predictor
This is data mining classification project which predicts diabetes for females based on input attributes. 
I have implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm in java which uses normal distribution to calculate the prior probability.
I have used Pima Indians data which was in csv format I created code to insert into DB and then used it in actual code.
To increase the accuracy I divided the data into three parts and then take average of it to predict the result.
Use CsvToDb.java to insert csv data into database.
